## Documentation Principles

### Conceptual Focus
All documentation focuses on concepts, architecture, and design rationale rather than code snippets. This approach:
- Remains relevant as code evolves
- Helps understand the "why" behind decisions
- Provides context for future changes
- Enables informed decision-making

### Comprehensive Coverage
Each document provides:
- Clear purpose and scope
- Detailed explanations of concepts
- Design rationale for decisions
- Best practices and guidelines
- Troubleshooting information
- Future enhancement considerations

### Interconnected Structure
Documents reference each other where appropriate:
- ARCHITECTURE.md provides the big picture
- Component docs dive deep into specific areas
- EVOLUTION.md explains historical context
- PIPELINE.md shows how everything works together

## Version History

## Contributing to Documentation

### When to Update Documentation

#### Architecture Changes
Update ARCHITECTURE.md when:
- Adding new components
- Changing component interactions
- Modifying design principles
- Updating technology stack

#### Feature Changes
