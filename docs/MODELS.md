# Pydantic Models and Validation

## Overview

Jobbernaut Tailor uses Pydantic for type-safe data validation throughout the pipeline. This document explains the model architecture, validation rules, error handling, and design rationale behind the validation system.

## Why Pydantic?

### Type Safety
Pydantic provides compile-time type checking that catches errors before they reach the rendering stage. This prevents entire classes of runtime errors.

### Automatic Validation
Models automatically validate data when instantiated. No need for manual validation logic scattered throughout the codebase.

### Clear Error Messages
When validation fails, Pydantic provides detailed, structured error messages that pinpoint exactly what went wrong and where.

### JSON Schema Generation
Pydantic models can automatically generate JSON schemas, which are used to instruct the AI on the expected output format.

### Performance
Pydantic is built on top of Python's type hints and uses Rust-based validation for performance-critical operations.

## Model Hierarchy

The validation system is organized into a hierarchical structure of models, each responsible for validating a specific aspect of the intelligence gathering phase, resume, or cover letter.

The system transforms Pydantic errors into AI-friendly feedback:

#### Error Message Format
```
Validation Error in [field_name]:
- Issue: [description]
- Expected: [requirement]
- Received: [actual_value]
- Fix: [suggested correction]
```

#### Multiple Errors
When multiple validation errors occur:
- All errors are collected
- Grouped by model/section
- Prioritized by severity
- Presented in logical order

### Retry Mechanism

#### Automatic Retry
When validation fails:
1. Capture all validation errors
2. Format errors into feedback message
3. Include original prompt and failed output
4. Request AI to regenerate with corrections
5. Validate new output
6. Repeat up to maximum retry attempts

#### Error Context Preservation
Each retry includes:
- Original job description
- Master resume data
- Previous failed attempt
- Specific validation errors
- Correction instructions

### Maximum Retry Limit
After exhausting retries:
- Log complete error history
- Provide detailed failure report
- Exit with error code
- Preserve failed output for debugging

---
