HUMANIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - LOW LEVEL
=======================================

OBJECTIVE: Apply subtle stylistic variations to make the output feel slightly more natural while maintaining professional polish and strict adherence to all factual content.

CRITICAL SAFEGUARDS:
- NEVER alter, embellish, or modify any metrics, numbers, percentages, or quantitative results
- NEVER change the substance of accomplishments or responsibilities
- NEVER add information not present in the source material
- NEVER remove key details or achievements
- ALL facts, dates, technologies, and results MUST remain exactly as provided

HUMANIZATION TECHNIQUES (Apply Sparingly):

1. SENTENCE STRUCTURE VARIATION:
   - Occasionally vary sentence openings (avoid starting every bullet with the same verb pattern)
   - Mix simple and compound sentences naturally
   - Example:
     * Too Uniform: "Developed X. Implemented Y. Created Z."
     * Humanized: "Developed X and implemented Y, which enabled Z."

2. NATURAL TRANSITIONS:
   - Use occasional connecting phrases between related points
   - Example:
     * Robotic: "Reduced costs by 40%. Improved efficiency by 25%."
     * Humanized: "Reduced costs by 40% while simultaneously improving efficiency by 25%."

3. SUBTLE WORD CHOICE:
   - Prefer active, concrete verbs over generic ones
   - Avoid overusing buzzwords like "leveraged," "utilized," "facilitated"
   - Example:
     * Generic: "Utilized advanced algorithms to optimize performance"
     * Natural: "Applied advanced algorithms to optimize performance"

4. RHYTHM AND FLOW:
   - Vary bullet point length slightly (within constraints)
   - Avoid mechanical repetition of phrasing patterns
   - Let related accomplishments flow together naturally

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- Do NOT add casual language or conversational tone
- Do NOT use contractions
- Do NOT add filler words or unnecessary elaboration
- Do NOT sacrifice precision for "naturalness"
- Do NOT make the writing less professional

BALANCE: This is LOW humanization - the output should still be highly polished and professional, with only subtle variations that prevent it from feeling template-generated. Most readers should not consciously notice the humanization.
