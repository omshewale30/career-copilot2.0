HUMANIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - MEDIUM LEVEL
==========================================

OBJECTIVE: Apply balanced humanization to create natural-sounding professional writing that avoids AI-generated patterns while maintaining accuracy and impact.

CRITICAL SAFEGUARDS:
- NEVER alter, embellish, or modify any metrics, numbers, percentages, or quantitative results
- NEVER change the substance of accomplishments or responsibilities
- NEVER add information not present in the source material
- NEVER remove key details or achievements
- ALL facts, dates, technologies, and results MUST remain exactly as provided

HUMANIZATION TECHNIQUES (Apply Moderately):

1. VARIED SENTENCE STRUCTURES:
   - Mix sentence patterns to avoid formulaic writing
   - Combine related achievements into compound sentences when natural
   - Vary the placement of metrics within sentences
   - Example:
     * Formulaic: "Developed system. Reduced latency by 60%. Improved throughput by 45%."
     * Humanized: "Developed system that reduced latency by 60% and improved throughput by 45%."

2. NATURAL LANGUAGE FLOW:
   - Use connecting words and phrases to link related ideas
   - Avoid starting consecutive bullets with identical verb patterns
   - Create logical narrative flow between accomplishments
   - Example:
     * Mechanical: "Led team. Implemented process. Achieved results."
     * Natural: "Led cross-functional team to implement new process, achieving 30% efficiency gains."

3. AUTHENTIC WORD CHOICE:
   - Replace overused corporate jargon with concrete, specific verbs
   - Avoid buzzword stacking ("leveraged synergistic solutions to optimize")
   - Use precise technical terms where appropriate
   - Example:
     * Buzzword-heavy: "Leveraged cutting-edge technologies to facilitate optimization"
     * Authentic: "Applied machine learning algorithms to optimize recommendation accuracy"

4. HUMAN PHRASING PATTERNS:
   - Occasionally use subordinate clauses for context
   - Include brief contextual phrases when they add clarity
   - Vary bullet point rhythm and length (within constraints)
   - Example:
     * Robotic: "Built API. Integrated with 5 services. Reduced response time by 40%."
     * Human: "Built RESTful API integrating 5 external services, reducing response time by 40%."

5. STRATEGIC EMPHASIS:
   - Place the most impressive metrics where they have natural impact
   - Use active voice consistently but vary sentence construction
   - Let accomplishments speak for themselves without over-qualification
   - Example:
     * Over-qualified: "Successfully managed to reduce costs by implementing optimization"
     * Direct: "Reduced costs 35% through infrastructure optimization"

6. CONTEXTUAL COHERENCE:
   - Ensure bullets within a role tell a coherent story
   - Connect technical work to business outcomes naturally
   - Avoid abrupt topic shifts between bullets
   - Example:
     * Disjointed: "Wrote Python scripts. Managed team. Reduced costs."
     * Coherent: "Developed Python automation scripts that reduced manual processing time by 50%, enabling team to focus on high-value analysis work."

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- Do NOT add casual or conversational language
- Do NOT use contractions or informal expressions
- Do NOT add subjective opinions or self-praise
- Do NOT sacrifice clarity for creativity
- Do NOT make claims beyond the source material
- Do NOT use clich√©s or empty phrases

BALANCE: This is MEDIUM humanization - the output should read like it was written by an experienced professional who writes clearly and naturally, not by someone following a template. The writing should feel confident and authentic while remaining polished and professional. Readers should find it engaging and easy to read without questioning its professionalism.
