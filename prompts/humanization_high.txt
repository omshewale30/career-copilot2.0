HUMANIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - HIGH LEVEL
========================================

OBJECTIVE: Maximize natural, human-like writing while preserving all factual accuracy. Create professional content that reads as if written by a skilled communicator, not generated by AI or templates.

CRITICAL SAFEGUARDS (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- NEVER alter, embellish, or modify any metrics, numbers, percentages, or quantitative results
- NEVER change the substance of accomplishments or responsibilities
- NEVER add information not present in the source material
- NEVER remove key details or achievements
- ALL facts, dates, technologies, and results MUST remain exactly as provided
- Humanization applies to STYLE and PRESENTATION, not SUBSTANCE

HUMANIZATION TECHNIQUES (Apply Liberally):

1. DYNAMIC SENTENCE ARCHITECTURE:
   - Actively avoid formulaic patterns and template-like structures
   - Weave related accomplishments into flowing, compound sentences
   - Vary sentence length and complexity to create natural rhythm
   - Place metrics strategically within sentences for maximum impact
   - Example:
     * Template-like: "Developed microservices architecture. Reduced deployment time by 70%. Improved system reliability to 99.9% uptime."
     * Humanized: "Architected microservices platform that cut deployment time by 70% while achieving 99.9% uptime through automated health monitoring and failover systems."

2. AUTHENTIC PROFESSIONAL VOICE:
   - Write as a confident professional would describe their own work
   - Use concrete, specific verbs that convey actual actions taken
   - Eliminate corporate buzzwords and jargon unless technically necessary
   - Let technical expertise show through precise terminology, not buzzwords
   - Example:
     * Buzzword-laden: "Leveraged synergistic cross-functional collaboration to facilitate optimization of mission-critical systems"
     * Authentic: "Collaborated with engineering and product teams to redesign core systems, reducing latency by 45%"

3. NARRATIVE COHERENCE:
   - Create logical flow between bullets that tells a story of impact
   - Connect technical implementations to business outcomes naturally
   - Show progression and growth within each role
   - Link related accomplishments to demonstrate comprehensive contributions
   - Example:
     * Disconnected: "Built dashboard. Analyzed data. Improved metrics. Led team."
     * Coherent: "Built analytics dashboard that surfaced key performance trends, enabling data-driven decisions that improved conversion rates by 28%. Led team of 4 analysts in expanding the platform to support 15 additional metrics."

4. VARIED LINGUISTIC PATTERNS:
   - Alternate between different sentence structures and openings
   - Use subordinate clauses to add context without wordiness
   - Incorporate transitional phrases that feel natural, not forced
   - Vary the rhythm and cadence of bullet points
   - Example:
     * Monotonous: "Created X. Implemented Y. Developed Z. Built A."
     * Varied: "Created X that enabled Y, while developing Z to support A. Built comprehensive B system integrating C and D."

5. STRATEGIC METRIC PLACEMENT:
   - Integrate numbers naturally into sentence flow
   - Avoid mechanical "achieved X% improvement" patterns
   - Let metrics enhance the narrative rather than dominate it
   - Example:
     * Mechanical: "Implemented caching strategy. Achieved 60% reduction in database queries. Resulted in improved performance."
     * Natural: "Implemented Redis caching strategy that reduced database queries by 60%, cutting average response time from 800ms to 320ms."

6. CONTEXTUAL DEPTH:
   - Include brief context when it clarifies impact without adding fluff
   - Show the "why" behind technical decisions when space permits
   - Connect individual contributions to broader team or company goals
   - Example:
     * Bare facts: "Migrated database to PostgreSQL. Reduced costs by $50K annually."
     * Contextual: "Led migration from Oracle to PostgreSQL to reduce licensing costs, saving $50K annually while maintaining sub-100ms query performance."

7. HUMAN DECISION-MAKING LANGUAGE:
   - Show agency and thoughtful decision-making in word choice
   - Use verbs that convey intentional action: "designed," "architected," "chose," "prioritized"
   - Avoid passive constructions and weak verbs
   - Example:
     * Passive: "Was responsible for system that was utilized to process data"
     * Active: "Designed data processing system handling 2M daily transactions"

8. PROFESSIONAL CONFIDENCE:
   - Write with quiet confidence, not boastfulness
   - Avoid hedging language ("helped to," "assisted in") when you led the work
   - Let accomplishments speak for themselves without over-qualification
   - Example:
     * Hedged: "Helped to contribute to the successful implementation of features"
     * Confident: "Implemented user authentication system supporting 100K daily logins"

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- Do NOT add casual, conversational, or informal language
- Do NOT use contractions, slang, or colloquialisms
- Do NOT add subjective opinions, self-praise, or emotional language
- Do NOT sacrifice precision or clarity for "naturalness"
- Do NOT make the writing less professional or less impressive
- Do NOT add filler words or unnecessary elaboration
- Do NOT use clich√©s, platitudes, or empty corporate speak
- Do NOT fabricate context or details not in the source material

BALANCE: This is HIGH humanization - the output should read like it was written by an articulate professional with strong communication skills who naturally writes in a clear, engaging style. The writing should feel authentic and confident while remaining thoroughly professional. Readers should be impressed by both the accomplishments AND the quality of the writing, without ever suspecting AI generation. The goal is maximum naturalness within the bounds of professional excellence.
